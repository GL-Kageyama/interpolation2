# Comparison of interpolation algorithms

## Linear method
Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

## Pattern 1 : Basic implementation in Python

## Pattern 2 : Linear method using Scipy's API
